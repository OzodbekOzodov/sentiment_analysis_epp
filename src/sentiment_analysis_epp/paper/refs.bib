 abstract = {Researchers have long measured people's thoughts, feelings, and personalities using carefully designed survey questions, which are often given to a relatively small number of volunteers. The proliferation of social media, such as Twitter and Facebook, offers alternative measurement approaches: automatic content coding at unprecedented scales and the statistical power to do open-vocabulary exploratory analysis. We describe a range of automatic and partially automatic content analysis techniques and illustrate how their use on social media generates insights into subjective well-being, health, gender differences, and personality.},

 abstract = {Twitter as one of vital platforms for people to publically express their opinions and feelings about events and their private lives, has attracted enormous attention with millions of followers (Li et al. 2013). Numerous studies have been conducted on opinion mining and sentiment analysis on Twitter (Pang & Lee 2008; Poria et al. 2014; Taboada et al. 2011; Liu 2012). The sentiment classification methods have been developed from simple text mining to advanced symbol and feature recognition (Liu 2012), from a pure sentiment analysis to a sentiment and subjective analysis (Pang & Lee 2004), from machine learning or lexicon-based approaches},
